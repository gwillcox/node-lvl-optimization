# A Node-Level Optimization Algorithm
In this project, I develop an optimization algorithm for networks of agents that does not rely on a global error 
function or the traditional backpropagation algorithm. 

Instead, the nodes each try to maximize their own information-processing capability, and their utility to other nodes in
the network in predicting the correct output function.
